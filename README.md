A personal customized remake of one of my favourite childhood games, Tetris (featuring custom blocks as well as gravity chain reactions).

This will be made in HTML/CSS/Javascript that it can easily be played from virtually all platforms.

Also, this will be a good exercise for me to thoroughly understand Javascript concepts, such as prototyping, scopes, closures, "this" and callback functions.
