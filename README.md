A personal customized remake of one of my favourite childhood games, Tetris (featuring piece-wise gravity and custom blocks for chain reactions and extra difficulty).

Made in HTML/CSS/Javascript so that it can easily be played from virtually all platforms.

Also, this is a good exercise for me to thoroughly understand Javascript concepts, such as prototyping, scopes, closures, "this" and callback functions.

This game can be played live here: http://comraq.github.io/My-Tetris/
